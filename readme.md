# Welcome to Simplif.io
This is a fun side project for me. Initially, I'm just planning on making a very rudimentary music sequencer, with mulligan ability, later adding features such as scales, modes, and eventually (hopefully) machine learning to assist in creating the perfect musical sequence.

## Why I started
I've been a musician my whole life and I needed a project to work on! This seemed like a fun way to mix the two worlds I've been living in, while also learning new technologies.

## State of the composition:
Currently this is completely barebones, and the minimum viable products aren't completed. I will update when it is completed.

## The technical stuff:
The current stack consists of HTML, Javascript, ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Webpack and Babel. I'm going to try to keep this running in a way that only uses client-side, instead of necessitating any database connection. My hope is to keep this offline capable, and fully open source, no black-box crap for you to deal with.

## How to use
Make sure you have NPM installed. Once you do, clone down the repo, and run <npm install>. When that's completed you should be able to use <npm run start>, then open up your browser and connect to <http://localhost:3000>. I'll implement an easier way to run this once it's, you know, actually working.
