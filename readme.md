# Welcome to Simplif.io
This is a fun side project for me. Initially, I'm just planning on making a very rudimentary music sequencer, with mulligan ability, later adding features such as scales, modes, and eventually (hopefully) machine learning to assist in creating the perfect musical sequence.

## Why I started
I've been a musician my whole life and I needed a project to work on! This seemed like a fun way to mix the two worlds I've been living in, while also learning new technologies.

## State of the composition:
Currently this is completely barebones, and the minimum viable products aren't completed. I will update when it is completed.
